# rag-chatbot
##Overview
This project features a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that interacts with users by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base and generating contextually appropriate responses. The chatbot leverages advanced natural language processing techniques to enhance conversational abilities and provide accurate answers.

#Tools and Libraries
Hugging Face Transformers: Used to retrieve and work with pre-trained models for natural language understanding and generation.
Pinecone: A vector database used for efficient and scalable similarity search in the knowledge base. Pinecone aids in retrieving relevant information based on vector similarity.
Google Colab: Used for development and running the project. It supports GPU acceleration to speed up model inference and training.

Install Dependencies:

Make sure you have pip installed. Then, install the required Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

How to Run
Set Up Google Colab:

Open Google Colab and create a new notebook.
Upload your project files to the Colab environment or clone the repository directly in the notebook.
Enable GPU Acceleration:

Go to Runtime > Change runtime type and select GPU as the hardware accelerator.
Run the Chatbot:

Execute the cells in your Colab notebook to run the chatbot. Ensure that all dependencies are installed, and your Pinecone details are correctly configured.

Configure Pinecone:

Replace placeholder values in your configuration files or Colab notebook with your Pinecone API keys and other necessary details.
Working Flow
User Input:

The user inputs a question or statement into the chatbot interface.
Retrieval Process:

Pinecone performs a vector similarity search in the knowledge base to retrieve relevant information based on the userâ€™s input.
The retrieved data is ranked based on its relevance to the query.
Generation Process:

The Hugging Face Transformers model processes the retrieved information to generate a coherent and contextually accurate response.
The generated response is crafted based on both the retrieved data and the input context.
Response Delivery:

The chatbot presents the generated response to the user through the interface.
If necessary, additional context or clarification may be requested from the user to refine the response.
Feedback Loop:

The system logs interactions for continuous improvement and monitoring.
Feedback or additional data from user interactions can be used to update and enhance the knowledge base and models.
